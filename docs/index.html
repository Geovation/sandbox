      <h2><a href="osbuilding_area_ratio.html">Stations Noise impact</a></h2>
      <p>This web application aims to measure the noise impact to buildings near any random railway station in the UK and Ireland within a 500m radius. This project used the content of the OS Vector Tile API in the "Road" style using the Tile matrix
        Set EPSG:27700, which included the following features names.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Open Zoomstack_Railway_Stations</li>
        <li>The Open Zoomstack_District_Buildings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can test the application by visiting <a href="osbuilding_area_ratio.html">Stations Noise impact</a>. You simply select a station from the dropdown menu and it generates the following information related to the station </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The total number of buildings within the radius</li>
        <li>Their total area</li>
        <li>The noise impact obtained by the ratio of buildings area to that of the radius</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
