      <h2><a href="osbuilding_area_ratio.html">Stations Noise impact</a></h2>
      <p>This web application aims to measure the noise impact to buildings near any random railway station in the UK and Ireland within a 500m radius. This project combined the following features from the OS Data Hub</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zoomstack Railway Stations</li>
        <li>Zoomstack District Buildings</li>
        <li>Mapbox GL JS to display a basic map using the "Road" style</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can test the application by visiting <a href="osbuilding_area_ratio.html">Stations Noise impact</a>. You simply select a station from the dropdown menu and it generates the following information related to the station </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The total number of buildings within the radius</li>
        <li>Their total area</li>
        <li>The noise impact obtained by the ratio of buildings area to that of the radius</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
