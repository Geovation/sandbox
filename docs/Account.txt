We were asked to experiment with the OS Features from the OS Data Hub. We had to think of a case where we could create a project that demonstrates some of the OS Features. We decided to consider the case of buildings being affected by noise of railways. 

For this project we could combine the features of Zoomstack Railway stations and Buildings features.

First, we copied and pasted the example code posted on the OS Labs, showing the number of Greenspace areas in a 1km radius.

At first glance, the code looks very complicated. Breaking this down into simpler issues has helped me understand the code better.
